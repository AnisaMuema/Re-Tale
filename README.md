# Re-Tale

---------------------------INTRODUCTION------------------------------


Re-tale is a platform that combines several useful tools to aid in running a retail store, such as inventory management and point of sale(POS). You can't afford to lose stock or write off unsold goods as a retail business. Re-Tale can take away the pain.

Manual inventory tracking is mistake-prone work, and because it's labour-intensive, the job often gets bumped when the shop gets busy. With Re-Tale, you can automate the process, updating your records in real-time as stock is bought and sold. 

Re-Tale can help retailers by providing multiple services in one place, streamlining the process of running a store. Managing your retail inventory with Re-Tale makes everything easier and faster.
